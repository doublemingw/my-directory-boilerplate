### 1. What is the Indie Hacker Tools?

The Indie Hacker Tools offers three core features:

- **Products**: Collects information on tools related to indie development, organizes them by category, and helps indie hackers quickly find the most suitable tools to speed up cooking.
- **Tutorials**: Gathers and writes tutorials related to indie development tools, helping indie hackers quickly get started with the best tools and apply them to their products.
- **Applications**: Collects and showcases applications created by excellent indie hackers, 100% FREE! Itâ€™s also a great place to find inspiration for new applications.

### 2. Why Did I Create the Indie Hacker Tools?

The reason is simple. As a new indie developer, I encountered some problems when trying to get started:

- What tools are needed for indie development? Which tools are best for me?
- What tech stack is required for indie development? How do I get started with these new techs?
- What are other indie hackers doing? Are they profitable? How do they make money?

The Indie Hacker Tools was created to solve these problems, aiming to lower the entry barrier for becoming an indie developer.

### 3. Will the Indie Hacker Tools Charge for Its Features?

Currently, there are no paid features. You can submit your indi applications for free (theyâ€™ll be displayed after approval), and you can also recommend excellent tools at any time.

Since I develop this site as a side project during my spare time, having no income does not affect my normal work and life. 

The siteâ€™s operating costs are almost zero, so there's no need to worry about the site shutting down due to lack of income.

### 4. How Will the Indie Hacker Tools Make Money?

The monetization model is not yet determined. Might consider joining affiliate marketing or accepting sponsorships via [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/javayhu).

### 5. Is the Indie Hacker Tools Open Source?

The Indie Hacker Tools is not open source for now. 

However, all product tools' data on this site is open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/javayhu/indie-hackers-site-data). 

Anyone can use this data to create their own Indie Hacker Tools.
